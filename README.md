Edited 0.29sw to allow for ZL to be rebound to X/Y and to unbind X/Y when doing so, since I was told having ZL rebound to X/Y was illegal.
To undo, do the button combo ZR + A. This will reset ZL ZR X Y to their default settings, so if you have a trigger jump bind reset it before doing this.
Its a kinda janky solution and I'm not too happy with it, but it ""works"" which is all i can really ask for tbh.

Repository for a modification of the Phob motherboard to fit an Hori Pad GCC

Potential issues: <br />

LR pads are a bit too small, you may need to glue them/stick them in place if you plan to use them. <br />

You have to cut the inner top of the shell and the start button. <br />
